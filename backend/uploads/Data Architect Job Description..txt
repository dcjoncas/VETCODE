What is the difference between a Data Architect and a Data Engineer?
Although both Data Architects and Data Engineers use coding to create databases and other types of data infrastructure, they have different areas of job focus. For example, Data Architects focus on coding visual aspects of a database, including display icons, buttons and other interactive components. They also create code that automates the data retrieval and storage process. In contrast, Data Engineers are responsible for creating and updating the framework of entire databases.
