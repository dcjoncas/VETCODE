== Answers from Fernando ==
One of my firsts websites was on Elementor, my challenges are that i didn't have enough experience with Elementor, so i had to work it out by searching for online solutions and forums on how to do what i need to do. Everytime i face a challenge i try to search for help as soon as possible searching online to find the faster and better way to solve my problem.
My strategies are using only needed tools to perform a project, exclude every theme, plugins and tools that i don't need. After done i try to analyze every little detail and see how i can optimize the performance like images and videos compression.
The work of implementing a structured data starts by doing a good job analyzing what really matter to have in the project.
In sometimes i did it by using plugins to specific needed. So i customize the layout and panel to my client's need, only letting the fields that my clients needed and after that i did video-calls or videos training them on how to feed content on the website.
I really don't remember using JetEngine or JetPlugins. If there is the needed of using them i'll search and learn in a faster way to be sure of the deliverability.

@Darrin Joncas from a quick look at his answers, I see 4 areas of concern you could dig into for this role
1.	Depth of Experience with Elementor:
•	Fernando admits to initially lacking experience with Elementor, which might raise concerns about his depth of expertise in using this specific builder for complex and large-scale projects. This could be a critical gap given the role’s emphasis on extensive Elementor experience.
2.	Structured Data and API Integration:
•	His approach to implementing structured data seems basic and primarily reliant on plugins without detailing any complex implementations. There is also no mention of experience with API integrations, which are important for enhancing content management and functionality in large-scale projects.
3.	Experience with Advanced Tools:
•	Fernando has not used JetEngine or JetPlugins and seems to lack experience with advanced custom fields beyond basic usage. His willingness to learn is positive, but the role might require someone who can immediately handle these tools without a learning curve.
4.	Management of Large-scale Websites:
•	There is a lack of specific mention or evidence of managing high page-count websites or optimizing performance at scale, which are key aspects of the job description.
