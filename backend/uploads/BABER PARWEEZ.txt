quiz for capturing user-specific care needs. These innovations led to a Year-over-Year
(YoY) increase in users/sessions, logins, and accounts created, subsequently driving up
the number of completed Customer Actions (CA). Consistently evolved front-end

platform.
WEB DEVELOPER - JERRAM, READING - JULY 2016 – MAY 2019

An online SAAS website created for a personal idea. Originally planned after a few
iterations of similar work requested in previous job roles—development is being

developed locally but will be live with a first iteration soon.
ALL CURVES - OCT 2022 – ONGOING
All Curves is an online e-commerce website created for a Brazilian client. The initial
concept used Next.js for the frontend, Sanity.io for the backend and Stripe for
payments. This final iteration was updated to use WordPress and WooCommerce due
to my experience in order to provide better support and ongoing maintenance.
QR MAPS - JAN 2016 – MAY 2016
Development of a new QR mapping and data mapping service that allows predefined
clients and affiliated users to see personal multimedia clips retrieved from a database
and mapped out onto web interface markers. As the sole developer for the project, I

development. The tech stack used in this project was PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
DRUMBOT - OCT 2015 – JAN 2016
DrumBot was the design, implementation, testing and publishing of an android
application. The original concept of the Android ‘Drumbot’ application was an
electronic dance music drum machine. The application design was based on the MPC
interface. All sounds used within the application were developed personally using the
FL Studio 10 music production software. The SoundPool method was used to manage
and play the audio.
